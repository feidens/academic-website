We currently develop cryptimeleon a Java library that is primarily aimed at prototyping and evaluation of privacy-preserving cryptography from research papers.
For a getting to know cryptimeleon and a 5 minute tutorial go to [cryptimeleon.org](https://cryptimeleon.org).
We are also looking for contributions (e.g. adding additional schemes), so feel free to follow the project on [github](https://github.com/cryptimeleon) and contact us.
